				<div class="collapse-card__body">
					Stem cell therapy treats physical pain and injury by adding natural cells that impact regeneration and healing. Once injected into the area of concern, the stem cells promote the natural regeneration process and may regenerate different types of tissue.

					Platelet rich plasma therapy treats physical pain and injury by increasing growth factors and decreasing inflammation. Once injected into the area of concern, the growth factors and chemicals will speed up the natural healing process. PRP can also be used in conjunction with stem cell therapy.

					The cost of treatment depends on injection type and injection location. Stem cell injections typically cost more than PRP injections.

					We offer stem cell injections from three sources - bone marrow, fat tissue, and amniotic fluid. The bone marrow and fat tissue stem cells are taken from the patient, processed, and injected into the area of concern. Amniotic fluid stem cells are taken from placental tissue. The placental tissue is donated by pre-approved, thoroughly screened individuals undergoing scheduled C-section births. The mother and child are not harmed during this process.

					Both stem cell and PRP therapies are considered safe with very minimal chance of adverse effect. Many of our therapies are considered experimental and are at the cutting edge of medical interventions. There is always risk involved with medical procedures and injections. These risks will be discussed more fully during the consultation.
